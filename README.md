# DDL.jl

- This package aims to provide utilities for working with any kind of data for Machine Learning (Deep Learning specifically)
- The main objective is to have a data loader of sorts which works with Flux.jl for any data
- This package also provides easy ways of downloading standard datasets from Computer Vision, Natural Language processing etc

## Documentation!!

- Please go to this link : [Docs](https://subhadityamukherjee.github.io/DDL.jl/build/index.html)

## Features (So far; I need it for my research so more is being added every day)

> Planned features -> [roadmap](https://github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/DDL.jl/blob/master/vision.md)

- Direct download of commonly used datasets for Computer vision, NLP etc(Beyond CIFAR and MNIST -.-) [Courtesy fastai]
- Image loader from multiple folders, CSV files
- Labeller based on file paths/custom functions
- Labeller based on patterns
- Label encoder
- Flux compatible data loader (aka use this library to load the data -> do whatever you want in Flux)
